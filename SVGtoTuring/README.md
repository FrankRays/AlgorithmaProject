# SVG to Turing
___
### What is it for?
Well... You see... I took a computer science (Grade 10) course in grade 9 hoping it would be fun. I heard that we got to develop games and such. *However*, before we got to the fun bit, we had to learn this (Canadian) programming language called **Turing**. The version used was OpenTuring v2.0. Anyways, our assignment was to create a comic using the language. Turing only has these drawing tools: Box, FillBox, Oval, FillOval and Arc. So, instead of doing this incredibly annoying assignment, I wrote a program that did it for me.

### How to use it 101
1. Draw the SVG you want converted into Turing. The SVG can only be drawn using the Circle, Rectangle, Line and/or Arc tool. All other tools will be ignored. Note well: **please keep all coordinate values integer, as that will greatly improve the accuracy of the outputted code**. I choose to use http://www.drawsvg.org/ as that gives the grid option. Open your image inside the editor, and enable & show the grid. That way all coordinate values will be an integer.
2. Select and open the SVG inside the program
3. Press the "Show Code" button to show the converted code.
4. Celebrate.
